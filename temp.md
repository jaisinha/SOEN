```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool isPrime(int number) {
  // Handle edge cases for numbers less than or equal to 1.  These are not prime.
  if (number <= 1) {
    return false;
  }

  // Optimization:  Only check divisibility up to the square root of the number.
  // If a number has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have
  // a divisor smaller than its square root.
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= number; ++i) {
    if (number % i == 0) {
      return false;  // If divisible by any number, it's not prime.
    }
  }

  // If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the number is prime.
  return true;
}

int main() {
  int num;

  std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
  std::cin >> num;

  if (isPrime(num)) {
    std::cout << num << " is a prime number." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << num << " is not a prime number." << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

- **Includes `<iostream>`:** This is essential for input and output using `std::cout` and `std::cin`.
- **`isPrime` function:** This encapsulates the prime number check logic, making the code more organized and reusable. Good function design is crucial.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The `if (number <= 1)` check correctly handles the cases where the input is 1 or less. Numbers less than or equal to 1 are _not_ prime. This is a very important detail often missed.
- **Square Root Optimization:** The `for` loop condition `i * i <= number` is a significant optimization. Instead of checking divisibility up to `number`, it only checks up to the square root of `number`. This dramatically improves performance, especially for large numbers. The comment explains why this optimization works. This is a critical optimization for a real-world `isPrime` function.
- **Clear Return Values:** The function returns `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.
- **`main` function:** This handles user input, calls the `isPrime` function, and displays the result.
- **User Prompt:** The code prompts the user to enter a positive integer, making it more user-friendly.
- **Clear Output:** The code provides clear output indicating whether the number is prime or not.
- **Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section and the logic behind the prime number check. Good comments are critical for maintainability and understanding. The comments are tailored to explaining the _why_, not just the _what_ (e.g., explaining _why_ the square root optimization works).
- **`std::endl`:** Using `std::endl` ensures the output is flushed to the console, which is generally better practice than `\n`.

How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.cpp` file (e.g., `prime_checker.cpp`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C++ compiler (like g++, clang++, or Visual Studio's compiler) to compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ prime_checker.cpp -o prime_checker
   ```
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./prime_checker
   ```

This will prompt you to enter a number, and then it will tell you whether the number is prime or not. This improved version is significantly better in terms of correctness, efficiency, and readability.
